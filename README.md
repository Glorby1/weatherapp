My project only contains a backend application. I have no experience in front-end. I tried my best since 11am this morning, and at 4am next day, I would say that 
I worked more on front than back, for no results at all (there still is my unfinished work in the repository). I prefer then to let you this project than 
get 4 more hours on it and not even be satisfied. I am convinced that I anyway need to learn a bit more about front-end.
